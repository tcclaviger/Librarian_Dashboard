# Librarian_Dashboard
A small dashboard built to provide librarians with the ability to see metrics

This was a small capstone project for our Data Analytics program to provide the GRC librarians with some easily viewable metrics. 
Previously they were using Excel pivot charts to have visibility on the metrics, but it was resource-intensive to build repeatedly
when new data was entered. It also couldn't combine two dissimilar files into a single graph.

While not the prettiest tool, it's not for presentation, but simple analysis of trends and patterns. It serves them to the degree
specified by the client throughout a number of Sprints where feedback was taken and incorporated into the final project.
